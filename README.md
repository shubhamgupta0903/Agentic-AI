## 3. Entities and Workflows

### **3.1 AI Virtual Agent Workflow**
1. User inputs a query via text or voice.
2. NLP model (Hugging Face, Rasa) processes the input and retrieves data from the CRM.
3. AI model (e.g., GPT-4, TensorFlow) generates and delivers a response.

### **3.2 CRM Workflow**
1. Data from interactions is stored in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
2. AI Virtual Agent retrieves user-specific data for personalized responses.
3. Admins monitor and update records using Salesforce or a custom CRM.

### **3.3 Website Workflow**
1. Pre-sales users browse products/services via React.js frontend.
2. Post-sales users log in via OAuth 2.0 for support.
3. Data is synced with CRM for unified management.

### **3.4 Mobile App Workflow**
1. Users log in using JWT tokens for secure sessions.
2. Data is fetched from CRM (Firebase, MongoDB) for personalized support and order tracking.
