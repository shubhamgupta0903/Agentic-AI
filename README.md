## 3. Entities and Workflows

### 3.1 AI Virtual Agent
- **Workflow:**
  1. User inputs a query via text or voice.
  2. NLP model processes the input and retrieves relevant data from the CRM.
  3. Response is generated and delivered to the user.

### 3.2 CRM
- **Workflow:**
  1. Data from user interactions is stored and processed.
  2. AI Virtual Agent retrieves data for queries.
  3. Admins monitor and update records as needed.

### 3.3 Website
- **Workflow:**
  1. Pre-sales users browse products and services.
  2. Post-sales users log in for support and updates.
  3. Data is synced with CRM for unified management.

### 3.4 Mobile App
- **Workflow:**
  1. Users log in to access order tracking and support.
  2. Data is fetched from the CRM.

## 4. Modus Operandi: Building to Deployment

### 4.1 Building
- **Design:**
  - UI/UX for website and app.
  - Conversational flow for Virtual Agent.
- **Development:**
  - AI Virtual Agent: Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
  - CRM: Salesforce or a custom-built solution.
  - Website: Use React.js and Node.js, or opt for Next.js for a unified framework that handles both frontend and backend seamlessly.
  - Mobile App: Flutter (To efficiently develop applications for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously).

### 4.2 Hosting
